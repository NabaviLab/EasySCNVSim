VarSimLab Documentation
========================

VarSimLab is a Docker-based package that is designed to study genomic variations in a given genome.
As of the current version (**nabavilab/varsimlab:1.0**), the simulator generates artificial short reads,
which harbor structural and copy number variations.
In addition, it simulates tumor heterozygosity (Ploidy and Subclones).

With a web-based interface running locally, it not only provides a convenient way of using the package,
but also runs efficiently generating data where it will be finally analyzed.

The next version of VarSimLab will ship with a visualization module to induce a better understanding of the generated data.
